Add an optional "Rating" field to all items across all categories. This field should:

- Be labeled as "Rating"
- Represent the overall rating for the item
- Accept numeric values (e.g., 0-5)
- Be optional/nullable
- Apply consistently across all item categories in the system
- Maintain existing data validation rules
- Not affect any existing fields or relationships

Please implement this field following the current database schema and validation patterns.
